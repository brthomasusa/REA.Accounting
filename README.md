Adventure Works Cycles is a large (fictitious) multinational manufacturing company that produces and distributes metal and composite bicycles to commercial markets in North America, Europe, and Asia.  The headquarters for Adventure Works Cycles is Bothell, Washington where the company employs 500 workers.  Additionally, Adventure Works Cycles employs several regional sales teams throughout its market base. 

The AdventureWorks database supports standard online transaction processing scenarios. Scenarios include Manufacturing, Sales, Purchasing, Product Management, Contact Management, and Human Resources. This database was developed by Microsoft to demonstrate the capabilities of SQL Server 2008 through 2014.  

My goal is to develop a three tier application that includes a Blazor Web assembly presentation layer, an asp.net core business layer,  the Adventure Works database as the storage layer.
